## GET AQUACHAIN

To begin, you must have the aquachain command installed.

The `aquachain` command is a portable program that doesn't really need an 'installer', you can run it from anywhere.

Apple/Linux Install: (Apple users, replace linux-amd64 with darwin-amd64)

	sudo mv aquachain /usr/local/bin/aquachain 	# install
	aquachain account new					# create new private/public key pair
	aquachain console				      # open console

Create an account: This will create a wallet address where the mining rewards are stored. By default the last address created is where the mining rewards are sent. Type the following:

```
aquachain account new
```

Your new wallet private key is located inside `datadir` by default is `~/.aquachain/`` or ``%appdata%\Roaming\AquaChain` (windows)

After creating a password for the wallet, start the AquaChain console by running the following:

```
aquachain console
```

Type `help` at the `AQUA>` prompt for common commands.
